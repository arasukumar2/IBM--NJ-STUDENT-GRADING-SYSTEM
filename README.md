# IBM--NJ-STUDENT-GRADING-SYSTEM-
1.Objective

The main goal of this project is to automate the student grading process.
It helps teachers quickly calculate grades based on marks, generate results, and store them in a database efficiently.
This system reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and allows students to view their results easily.

2.Description

The IBM NS-Student Grading System is a web-based application that allows teachers to manage student marks and generate final grades automatically.
Teachers can log in, enter marks for each student, and the system calculates grades based on predefined rules.
Students can view their results securely using their login credentials.
The project supports data storage, easy result retrieval, and report generation.

3.Modules / Features

1.	Login Module – Secure login for admin, teachers, and students.
2.	Student Management – Add, update, or delete student details.
3.	Marks Entry – Teachers can enter marks for subjects.
4.	Grade Calculation – Automatic grade generation based on marks.
5.	Result Generation – Display and download student results.
6.	Admin Dashboard – Manage users, view reports, and handle settings.
7.	Database Management – Store student, marks, and grade data safely.

4.Tech Stack

•	Frontend
The frontend of the IBM NS-Student Grading System is designed to provide a user-friendly and responsive interface for students, teachers, and administrators.
It allows smooth navigation between pages and clear data presentation.
 Frontend Features
•	Login Page: Secure login for admin, teachers, and students.
•	Dashboard: Displays key information like total students, results, and quick actions.
•	Student Form: Easy form to add, edit, or delete student details.
•	Marks Entry Page: Teachers can input marks for each student and subject.
•	Result Page: Students can view their grades and overall performance.
•	Responsive Design: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile screens.
 Frontend Technologies
•	HTML5 – Structure of web pages.
•	CSS3 – Styling and layout design.
•	JavaScript (ES6) – Adds interactivity and validation.
•	React.js / EJS – For building dynamic UI components.
•	Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS – For responsive, modern design.
 Frontend Workflow
1.	User opens the app in a web browser.
2.	The UI connects to backend APIs (Node.js / Express).
3.	Data (like marks or results) is fetched or sent through API requests.
4.	Pages dynamically update to display the latest information.

•	Backend
The backend of the IBM NS-Student Grading System** handles all the main logic**, data processing, and communication between the user interface and the database.
It ensures secure authentication, accurate grade calculation, and smooth data flow.
Backend Features
•	User Authentication: Secure login for admin, teachers, and students using JWT or session handling.
•	CRUD Operations: Add, update, delete, and fetch student and marks data.
•	Grade Calculation: Automatically compute grades based on predefined rules or score ranges.
•	Result Generation: Generate and store student results for viewing and downloading.
•	Error Handling & Validation: Ensures all data entered is valid and consistent.
•	API Endpoints: Provides RESTful APIs for frontend interaction.
 Backend Technologies
•	Node.js – Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
•	Express.js – Framework for building APIs and handling routes.
•	MongoDB / MySQL – Database for storing student records, marks, and grades.
•	Mongoose / Sequelize – ORM or ODM for database operations.
•	bcrypt.js – For password encryption.
•	JWT (JSON Web Token) – For secure user authentication.
 Backend Workflow
1.	The frontend sends a request to the backend (e.g., login, add student, enter marks).
2.	The backend validates the request and interacts with the database.
3.	If authentication is valid, the server processes the data (e.g., calculates grades).
4.	The backend sends a structured response (JSON) back to the frontend.
5.	Data is displayed to the user through the interface.
•	Database:  MySQL
•	Tools & Platforms:
o	Render.com (Deployment)
o	GitHub (Version Control)
o	IBM Cloud / IBM Developer Tools (for integration)

5.Workflow (How It Works)
1.	User Login:
Admin, teacher, or student logs in using their credentials.
2.	Data Entry:
Teachers enter student marks through the web interface.
3.	Grade Processing:
The backend system calculates grades automatically using the grading logic.
4.	Result Generation:
Final results are generated and displayed to students.
5.	Database Update:
All information (marks, grades, student data) is stored in the database.
6.	Result Access:
Students can log in and view their final results anytime.
